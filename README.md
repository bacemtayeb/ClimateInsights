# Time Series Forecasting with Apache Spark and Google Cloud

## Overview

Climate Insights highlights distributed processing systems capabilities (Apache Spark) for real-time analysis performed on meteorological data,aiming to thoroughly understand and predict atmospheric phenomena. This work employs PySpark, a Python API for Apache Spark, Spark Streaming and cloud computing (Google Cloud) to process large meteorological data
in real-time. The analysis, performed in a mutli-cluster environment, delivers comprehensive and useful insights accessible via a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit. This abstract highlights the projectâ€™s importance and its potential impact on improving weather forecast techniques while relying on distributed processing systems.

## Key Features

- **Real-time data acquisition:** We continously scrape and update the model with data from different resources.
  
- **Data Processing:** Deploying Apache Spark on Google Cloud for data processing. Additionally, we perform time series analysis.

- **Weather Forecasting:** Meta's open-source model Prophet is used for the forecasting phase.
